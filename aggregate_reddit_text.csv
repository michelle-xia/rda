I'm coming from a finance background (finance undergrad) and noticed they have certain coursework requirements that I didn't do in my undergrad. Namely multivariable calculus. Do you think it's still worth a shot applying ? I've been self-studying for about 9 months completing a lot of MOOCS and projects for my GitHub.

,,How can you lower tuition AND have hazard pay?  Alternatively why have hazard pay if you dont have in person classes?  This doesnt make a ton of sense
,,"These students in almost all likelihood already had the virus and came to school and are now just figuring out they had it. Again, 1 in 53 people. UT and the US have just not bothered on testing people. There are likely hundreds of people at UT right now that have it. These numbers are simply from people who have been tested, students/young adults are not able to afford/aren't scared enough to get tested."
,,"The biggest issue is the number of out of state and foreign students that are admitted, but these are the students they make the most money from. Some would argue that a state college should focus on students from the state. I understand that they also need the $ and need to ensure a diverse culture.  Just a problem of supply and demand."

Errors on slides and assignments, ambiguous wording on exams, deciding on the grading breakdown (% exam vs % assignment, etc.) and grade cutoffs.

So I'm trying my luck for spring 2021 on UT DS and UPenn MCIT.

,,I would be interested to see the SARS study. How were they sure that the faulty ventilation was causal to infection? Couldn't it just have been people coming into close contact and transmitting it between each other?
,,Articles are being written with a very limited perspective on matters and are making it seem like this is completely the fault of students or that it's a surprise. It's belittling and really just feels like it's all being done to turn blame on students as soon as the refund period is over and everyone is screwed.
,,"YOUR issue, is thinking that this somehow means the song is not complicit in the disrespect and oppression of black people. IT IS. You think of the minstrel show directors of this time as those who really just loved plays and had to work within the confines of the culture at the time. How hard is it for you to fathom that someone in 1903 was absurdly racist? The song was created to boost a show that stereotyped and bastardized black people. You wont accept this because you cant confront this reality."

One story is that you become awesome at onboarding, training, and mentoring data professionals (even if you are less technical yourself). Another angle is something more industry specific (""I'm a GOAT at managing analytics teams in real estate companies"")."

,,"So I get where youre coming from as far as how things change meaning. I dont think a state flag and a school song are comparable. The state flag has always just been that, a state flag.

If you want to do something a bit more ""classical"" statistics, then a MS in Statistics  may make more sense. This is very general and this is not a strict rule, obviously."

,,What was your view of UT vs OMSCS vs OMSA?
,,I actually hear finance people are good candidates as well. I talked with an admission counselor for Berkely MIDS about strong candidates. He said Business and Engineering were the strongest candidates they've had.
,,I haven't tried this out but I heard somewhere that you could call 311 and report parties. I'll probably try it this Friday just for fun LOL
,,"So maybe the root of the question should be, Stats Vs CS?"

,,"If you are in Texas, maybe go with UT because it might be preferred over GT by local employers."
,,I am
,,I disagree. I think data science are really applied statistics degree with a heavy emphasis on computing. MS in Statistics degrees can be quite theoretical and it's possible you have only one class that you briefly touch R with.
,,Congratulations on being accepted to both programs! I applied to UT MSDS as well but for regular decision round. Think I missed the GT OMSCS deadline for spring 2021 and lack the math and cs prerequites since I wasn't from tech/eng background... I also applied to Penn MCIT and it looks like UT and Penn will have their results around the same time! Already being nervous

,,"It was also sung by actors in blackface. The song was used because it was a hit at the minstrel show, so they continued using it AT the minstrel show. So yes, it was used as a way to reinforce the negative stereotypes of black people."
,,Completely agree
,,"These aren't efforts in the wrong direction. If a racist song is the main entity that ""unites"" longhorns, that is a problem in itself."

,,Okay with that logic we should go all the way back to the first people to discover fire...
,,"It wasn't available to me. But, if I was choosing now, only having ~12/13 classes to choose from still out of 10 you need to take is a huge negative for me. I'm sure they are great classes, but I need the breadth that OMSCS currently has. Fortunately it seems UT is adding a class a semester? I could be wrong there but it could very quickly become a great alternative, not to mention the class sizes would be much smaller. Additionally, they are much more selective at the moment for the online program (which I don't mean to say is an absolute positive or objectively preferable), but it might mean during a lot of group projects you're not left with absolutely clueless people who make you question if you are even in a Masters program like OMSCS made me do a few times."
,,"Thank you SO much for this feedback. Given everything you said, the problem I'm having is that I am coming from a business finance background... and have recently been admitted to Oregon State's Post Bacc CS program...

If they had a filter, it'd probably be 3.0 & up. 2.5 years doesn't sound like a ton of work experience, but you've been in a relevant field. You have problem-solving skills from ME and very good fundamentals from Math, which would be valued for a DS degree (arguably all math and stats). ML experience will definitely help too. All relevant things make me think you'd be a qualified candidate."

We did not learn any coding during classes, but more theoretical knowledge. Some classes were obviously fully pen-and-paper while in others we had practical homework and projects. There were some projects that made use of very specific programming languages (e.g. we had a big cluster for distributed computing and were provided access to it via Lua scripts; in another class, we used Promela for modeling), but in general, knowledge of languages was not demanded, but rather concepts and the ability to produce results whatever the language."

However in most other programs there are options for the mandatory theory courses."
,,In which case I think you can make a story of like big fish small pond and you want to move to bigger and better things in which case you need to get more technical. So given all that I think you're headed in the right direction. The only thing I'll say about a master's CS is its actually not that developer heavy. It's usually more about graduate level algorithms and if you're interested in Machine Learning most programs now have those classes. The only benefit of having a bit of an intro software engineering class is that they'll teach you good design practices. So you will be able to write scripts/ basic code that is maintainable which will make you stand out if you end up doing more analysis down the road.

,,"I chose OMSCS simply because it had more current course offerings and has been around longer. I think UT Austin is more selective, and with the GRE requirement, the application process is more difficult. I think class sizes would be smaller with UT Austin (for now) since its newer and more selective. I also heard it's more math focused than OMSCS, which was a plus for me, but so far, I feel like the actual math that makes up some concepts is glossed over in the class that I'm in now (AI for Robotics). I applied to both programs, and in that process, I felt that UT Austin's felt much more personalized. GT's admissions process was actually quite a headache. I made a video outlining it more if you feel obliged to hear more: https://youtu.be/RJvHAAk8xvQ"

,,White Americans' anti-affirmative action opinions dramatically change when shown that Asian-American students would qualify more in admissions because of their better test scores and fewer white students would get in for just being white.

Hartzell wants us to reclaim the song with its redefined meaning, understanding its past, but using it to continue to unite past and present students alike. The worst thing Ive seen so far regarding this, is those calling out hartzell that he cant reclaim it basically because he isnt black, meaning had he been, everything would be fine.

This allows the codes to be more flexible - you don't need to know where the flash address starts for all 5000 MCUs STM has. All you need to know is how to use the HAL.

,,Not sure how helpful this information is:
,,I chose CS bc I actually really like the art of programming while keeping DS in the loophole. CS is broader so I don't have as much fear of pigeon-holing.
,,This is a massive red flag...the data tsunami is coming. I'm glad you've decided to go down the technical route anyway.
,,Oh for sure me too. The low cost tuition is what really reeled me in. I asked Berkeley how much their OMSCS is and they said $70k which is ridiculous.
,,Are the PCT tests with saliva PCR tests?
,,That's awesome to hear you applied to UT MSDS! keep me posted. I was hoping my blog post and acceptance during the priority deadline would be helpful for people who were aiming for regular decision and haven't submitted their application yet.
,,Thanks! Sept 24th
,,"All in all, it looks like a worthwhile degree within the realm of online DS degrees. Take that as you will."
,,"But you right, I should be comparing UT's OMSCS. I didn't look into it haha"
,,"This is the same strategty that the gun lobby uses to overturn gun control laws.  Sue, and sue, and sue, and finally one case will stick and go high enough to a court that can overturn it."
,,"I'm almost tempted to apply to UT Austin, take some courses and the apply in the future to GATech with credit transfer if I still think GATech is better at that point."
,,My main words of optimism:
,,"Sure, every class I had (except for my statistical learning one, for which I used AWS for my final project; and the C course I mentioned) required R. This is obviously not a traditional route that most MS statistics students go through, but IMO, any degree is what you make of it. I am doing my best to fight off being the stereotype of a statistician who doesn't know how to program."
,,I read somewhere that some school (not sure it was UT) was telling students they would lose existing course credit or not be readmitted if they skipped a term.
,,or how about UT puts its students first and doesn't force their students to play a song that makes them feel uncomfortable. How can you even say that the song doesn't have a racist past?
,,For sure. And you can look into reading comprehension lessons.
,,"Why in the hell should an Asian be at a disadvantage for admissions compared to a white kid? (u/mike220v, for when mods delete it)"
,,Thanks man.  I was totally writing this for all those 4 year olds with the latest Samsung Galaxy.
,,Idk man something about white people complaining about institutional discrimination against them just hits different.
,,Its an attempt to artificially correct for outcome differentials in society. And its done by discriminating based on race.

,,I STRONGLY feel that most people will get more value out of GA Tech's online master's in CS than any interdisciplinary data science degree.
,,So racial discrimination is fine as long as its the right kind of racial discrimination?
,,"Not a tradition, no"
,,Sure. Often the thesis suggestion comes up in the context of being more competitive for a PhD program.  Heres a Twitter thread about my view of how that works:
,,Whats not fine is blanket racism being applied to admissions regardless of circumstance in a quest for racial quotas.
,,"My roommate got a antibody test after the fact and came up positive, she had some symptoms that she thought were allergies. It is very hard to tell for some people, but for others it is life threatening and something that you should be cautious about at all times."
,,So I think there are some valid points raised about Data Science degrees in general..but at the same time UT Austin is a top school and this degree is going to be considerably cheaper then any MS Stats program that you can find from comparable institutions.
,,"I would always recommend applying. You could always get in, defer it until you feel ready or they might give you conditional acceptance until you take the pre-reqs. Another thing to note is they waived GRE for this application bc of COVID. It was originally required. You might want to take advantage of that while it still lasts."
,,"Would it be better, given these characteristics, to seek the MS in Stats then?"
,,(please tell me you get that reference)
,,Im aware that this would disproportionately help certain races over others but at least it isnt using race as the primary factor. In fact it would likely have a similar outcome as the current system. But the question wouldnt be what color is your skin? It would be how much did you do with what you were given?
,,"""I don't think young kids would have phones or tablets.  I mean, I guess they could borrow one from their parents"""
,,For sure if neither works out I will keep on the fight to take courses from local cc and keep trying my interest in cs/ds. However UT CS seems to have the reputation of being too research/phd oriented which is scaring people like me away. Because I'm not so committed to academia.
,,A few pros and cons of OMSCS:
,,I would like to beat this stupid virus so we can have actual classes back. Wear your goddamn masks and be smart people.
,,"I'd support a poverty-based affirmative action, but let's try the poverty-based affirmative action (which did gain traction once and was killed off by affirmative action opponents). Asians enjoy a much higher financial outcome than any other race/group, except the Jewish. So is this class discrimination against the average Asian? Is this class discrimination against the average Jewish? Is this class discrimination against the average White?"
,,Not sure how many more days of wait now.

,,"No, not really. Look at how the Chinese, the South Koreans, or the Vietnamese did it. In fact, China is already returning back to normal and they are the only major economy expected to grow. If we did what those Asian countries did, we would be in a much MUCH better situation than we are in currently, and would probably be returning back to normal."
,,"So how do you transfer the stuff you learned on STM to TI? Or from MCU A to MCU B? At its core, everything is the same. GPIO ports are still GPIO ports, there is flash memory in both MCUs. What you need to know is find out (or learn to find out) where those small differences lie and how to address them. For example, if you know how to read a datasheet (or reference manual) for MCU A, learn how to find the same information on MCU B's datasheet."

,,- Less selective if that matters to you. That doesn't mean it's bad though - there are many students with stellar profiles.
,,Selective colleges hunger for athletes also benefits white applicants above other groups.
,,Idk. Some professors do like teaching in person instead of doing zoom calls.
,,"Yeah, it looks like many people are taking 2-4 courses in a semester while working, so that seems like less time consuming/easier courses. Not the insane GT courses requiring 40+h/week..."
,,Administrative and support staff have to be on campus regardless of online or in person class decisions.
,,"Yup, I agree. I think asking for letters of rec are a huge pain and not sure how much value they actually add."
,,"I could actually see UT doing something like that, though.   If too many kids decide to skip a few semesters for COVID, revenues would go down, so they'd need to accept more new students.  It wouldn't surprise me if they made returning students go to the back of the line for readmission."
,,"Thank you! If it makes you feel better, I didn't know about GT OMSCS 2 days before the deadline. I submitted my application on the due date 7/1/2020. Fortunately I still made it in! Keep your hopes up, I saw a lot of people who don't have previous experience. I don't really have any CS experience either"
,,"talking about that tp, i wipe my ass with it"
,,"edit: I don't know what your interests are but if you are interested in statistical inference, I don't think OMSCS has much even including the ML track.  You might be able to pick those up in the IYSE courses but I think in OMS you can only take 2 non CS / CSE courses."

So I'm trying to find the same information that I found on Nucleo's datasheet on TI's datasheet. When I'm implementing the projects, I'm trying to find the equivalent information I found on TI on the Discovery's datasheet. This is allowing me to learn how to read datasheets and how to find the same information on different datasheets + implement the same thing I implemented on MCU A on MCU B. I know this sounds a bit complicated, especially if you're just starting off - but mate, I'm a business degree holder (BBA + MBA) and never studied a single line of physics/electricity etc. Really believe me when I say this: If I can get this far, anyone can. So good luck :)"

The down side is it's kind of more similar to an MBA and you hell no'ed that.

,,Could the current band come up with another song that represents unity and inclusion? Or perhaps a contest amongst all UT students and voted upon? That would be cool and the story behind it for years to come would be appreciated. There is so much talent in that school I would love for the song to come from a student and I think more then ever students need something to bring them together and this could be it.

One way to look at that would be to search for jobs with your current title (or similar) and look at the requirements / responsibilities and compare vs your day to day.
,,"Awesome! I have seen more applicants with engineering background or from tech companies got in, definitely getting cold feet there. And I honestly am not so sure about CS vs DS since I'm taking online courses in both and they are fun to learn as a beginner (finger crossed it could stay the same). I am accountant and financial analyst in manufacturing so at first I thought I could just explore around data analytics field to advance my career and hopefully join a tech company later. But as the learning and researching on programs goes I found there are CS programs that also provides ML track. And that's why now I'm looking up each programs ;)"

,,If UT wants to change the world (for the better) we need to start on campus. Simple as that.
,,Is it easier? Ga tech is pretty demanding. Something that was similar in coverage and not quite as tedious would be nice.

,,And thats a much better question to be asked in admissions
,,A positive for UT is that it was built from the ground up specifically addressing the need for DS education rather than thrown together from existing courses. Also UT already has a well known analytics masters and their CS program is top notch.
,,"Also, it's not like you can only get into data science with just a CS or a statistics degree. That's a false assumption. You can get into data science with degrees in other fields, including economics, political science, psychology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. It's not a coincidence why Stanford's political science department offers a data science track, or why BC's economics department offers a machine learning class, or why UMichigan's epidemiology department offers a ML course"
,,"When I was there (I was a freshman in 2009), they barely acknowledged the interdisciplinary field of data science but had strong Computer Science departments (and mediocre Math / Statistics departments).

,,Got the same -- anyone here any advice on what to expect?
,,"All? No. Some? Yes. A MS in Data Science program with a good track record and brand name is probably worth it.

I hear he's one of those professors whose research is brilliant but a terrible teacher though lol."

,,Finally this is just my opinion but going from Director of Analytics to Data Scientist seems like a soft demotion. Yes you can sell it that you're more interested in analytical stuff but it's still a tough sell. I think the better sell is you want to introduce/upgrade fix current problems at your company and you need new skills to do it in which case you can find business problems at your current job where CS + DS will save the day.

,,"Im a freshman, and cannot speak about the Castilian (Ive heard mixed things about it), but I do live in Jester West. I love the campus location, its relatively quiet, in a good spot on campus, easy access to Clark Field, the gym, dining halls, etc. The difference between east and west is basically nonexistent, as far as I can tell.

,,"Hard for me to say on how convenient Jester or Castilian is distance-wise since theyre basically on opposite ends of campus. I was a transfer student so I have no clue where freshmen/core classes are generally located, so thats something to keep in mind as well."
,,"It is not cheap tho, thats the main drawback of living in a dorm. Its pretty damn overpriced."
,,"Kidwell by a mile, but it doesn't look like he's teaching it next semester, unfortunately"
,,"If youre wanting to explore some related options outside of CNS, I would recommend looking into Health Promotion and Behavioral Science in the College of Education. It combines interests in people, health, society, and disparities. Very interesting and definitely relevant to both fields. Also features some really awesome professors and smaller class sizes."
,,I lived in jester west for 3 semesters then went to wampus (not the Castilian). Im doing double occupancy with a parking spot for $650 per month. ($500 for no parking)
,,"Also theres always at least one broken elevator at Castilian with everyone trying to get on at once stopping at every of the 22 floors, so prepare at least 15 minutes in advance for that. Maybe its not as bad with the pandemic and largely online classes now, but given that I graduated at a weird transition time when most people went home, I cant speak for what thats like now."

,,Almost every stream option for FRI is great! Ive had loads of friends across many majors take different dreams and they all liked them. Except for me. I unfortunately took Quantum Computing for my FRI and it is hands down the worst decision I made in college.
,,BAM - I think (correct me someone if Im wrong here) the only FRI stream that gets you OChem lab credit.
,,Being able to have a full meal past 8pm and choose exactly what you eat is a game changer. Having a living room allows me to distance myself from my roommate. Being able to control the thermostat is pretty cool too.

,,"I only ever took M 340L (Matrices) myself, and I found that being an existing CS student made the class a whole lot easier. Given that, I'm not sure what it would be like to take the class as a non-CS, but it pairs very well with general CS."
,,Reach out to your classmates and create online study groups - it's a good way to meet people with similar interests.
,,"Greek life can be noisy and exclusive as you stated, and my first year it was a big issue but the following years it wasnt nearly as loud/obnoxious. Its really unpredictable as it depends on whos living there each year."
,,"If you were looking at it strictly statistically, both would be equally or very similarly difficult to get into because they're both in the college of natural sciences.  I think the difference in difficulty to get into certain majors comes up when the majors are in two different colleges like nutrition (college of natural sciences) vs kinesiology (college of education, idk why).  someone correct me if i'm wrong"
,,"On a side note, if youre a chem Major and genuinely want to learn Chemisty, Id suggest looking elsewhere in terms of professors. I took Dr. Walker in 301/302 and it was tough, but I can honestly say I wouldnt be as proficient with things had I taken a prof like laude which I wouldve treated more like a blow off because his class is easier. However, if you want an relatively easy experience in chem and youre good at teaching yourself, Laude is the way to go. Best of luck mate!"
,,"The food is hit or miss, but Id say its unfortunately miss ~75% of the time, with a lot of reheated leftovers and/or poor selections. Again, I stayed more so for the convenience since I was too lazy/busy to cook. From the times I visited friends at Jester and stayed overnight for orientation, I definitely prefer the quality/size of the rooms and cleanliness of Castilian."
,,"The course was called data science for engineers, and it was taught using jupyter notebooks in python. We used a bunch of external libraries, so most of the syntax is pretty specific but it's well documented. As long as you're familiar with python in general you'll be able to pick it up just fine."
,,"Im a sophomore and I got into Jazz appreciation pretty easily. I dont know how early I was in registration though. Great class though, easy and interesting!"
,,I actually made an appointment for a covid test at jester and then saw voting started at Greg so just did both. btw I heard Homeslice is giving away a free slice of pizza if you show up to the window with your sticker:)
,,"If I remember correctly Jazz appreciation is a blowoff UGS or VAPA, so its gonna fill quickly. Unfortunately, since youre a freshman I doubt that youll have a guaranteed chance, but you can get lucky as Im sure freshman have taken it in the past."
,,"Stayed at Castilian my entire time at UT from 2017 until I graduated in May this year. I really liked the single suite rooms, and the convenience of the meal plan and distance from campus was too good for me to give up."
,,"But I can't speak to Linear Algebra as /u/LukaDoncicMFFL mentioned, since I never took the course nor did I go into ML or graphics."
,,"In general most people that are not freshmen do not live on campus, I know two guys that were in ROTC and didn't live on campus ever."
,,"I think it still does because the class talks a bit about African American culture. Also, i recommend the class(took it this semester). It's not that much work and you don't need a textbook. Just $10 for cerego which is kinda like a daily 3min quizlet. Thats basically all the homework you have apart form writing assignments that are pretty short and easy. Prof is nice and the online class actually doesn't bore me."
,,"I had Davis and I liked it. Had her last year and I ended up with a B. She lets you have cheat sheets and I think if you get 100s on the quiz you dont have to take the final or something like that. Either way, she was fine."
,,"Join Texas THON! We are one of the largest student run philanthropic organizations in texas and the largest at UT! We raise funds and awareness for our local childrens miracle network hospital, Dell Childrens. There are so many miracle makers all over campus who individually fundraise or are apart of a team! Its a super fun and an easy way to meet new people, especially because we are hosting a bunch of virtual events! Look us up on instagram @texasthon or go to texasthon.org (Sorry that was a lot! lmk if you have any questions)"
,,Mine got transferred. I also took a humanities class to satisfy the lower division Writing Flag.
,,"I'd look at one of Dr. Iyoob's courses. I took one that focused more on machine learning, I know the previous semester he taught one which was more about optimization. I took it as a senior undergrad, but I'm pretty sure there were some grad students in the class."
,,"As for making friends, all the friends I have made have been through study groups and group chats, my location has had nothing to do with it."
,,"Beyond this, every so often, we also have been hosting member events such as virtual game night and virtual movie night."
,,You could also take SWE. Its a really valuable class and theres an upper div writing flag.
,,"If you're an engineering major, Davis by far! I had her when classes were in person, so I can't speak to how things have changed to be online. When I had her, she was eclectic and engaging. She's more focused on problem solving strategies rather than drilling theories or equation memorization which is ideal unless you're a math or physics major. Her exams and quizzes are all straight forward and short. If you do the practice she provides, you can expect an A or high B"
,,I'd check out subleases for next semester. There are still plenty of people planning to stay home who are stuck with a lease the are paying for. You might be able to pick up single occupancy close to campus through a sub-lease for a much cheaper price than Jester or Castillian
,,"Its best to talk to an advisor. Transfer courses and flags are less straightforward than they should be. In the meantime, you can run a degree audit. If the transfer courses arent on your UT audit yet, plug them into a planning audit. If youre not a UT student yet, use the automated transfer equivalency page to get started. In general, its easier to register for a course and drop it when registration reopens than to try and add it later."
,,"If I were you Id have backup VAPAs and UGSs on deck, you go to UT there are very few true blowoff classes I have come to find out, even with a rated 4.5+ professor on rate my professor (which I HIGHLY recommend using)."
,,"Im currently at Casty, and sure, theres a greek life presence here (and Im in it), but Id absolutely disagree that its harder to make friends here. What my (and many others who Ive asked about this) impression has been is that the overwhelming majority of people at Casty are extremely social and extremely friendly. Whether youre in the elevator, cafeteria, or lounge area on floor 11, people are always down to socialize, to have you at their table (if you ask), to hang out, etc. And if youre ever feeling particularly lonely or bored, go down to floor 11 and the chances are there will be a group of people hanging out who are watching a sport on tv or playing poker or cards against humanity or ping pong or pool or who are studying and would love for you to join them. Originally, my roommate and I were going to do Jester, but we switched to Casty last minute and do not regret the decision whatsoever."
,,Plenty of math classes have it
,,"Well I know that the commute from SA to Austin can range anywhere from 1hr-1.5hrs or sometimes longer due to traffic on I-35 (this is just the trip to, not the trip to and back). Personally i think it would be a more reasonable commute if you lived in San Marcos which is in between both cities but ofc this is just a recommendation. I don't know if driving for 2-3hrs each trip is something you'd want to do if you live in San Antonio"
,,"IMO, UT is doing a very good job. I would say that most courses are online and although there are a few social events, that probably compromises a spec of the UT student body."
,,"not sure about jazz appreciation, but i have ch301 with laude, and he has said that there is a survey they send out that his current students mark if they plan to take ch302 with him next sem, and if they are, they automatically get a spot reserved. any spots left will be open for other students to get a seat afterwards, but i assume a chunk will be gone due to that, so it will be harder"
,,Pretty sure BIO206L is hybrid w/ in-person labs next semester according to the course schedule. It was online this semester
,,"Out of those two, linear algebra would have more applications in fields such as machine learning and graphics. But a more practical class would likely be Discrete Math since it forms a better foundation for Algorithms courses and other CS Theory courses."
,,Edit: paragraph spacing to be less of an eyesore
,,"Im having the same kinda issue a bit, and i have been thinking the people that wanna get more involved/get out of their apartments also may be the ones showing up on campus more. the weather is getting nice, maybe just check it out and spend some time there. its not exactly dead like you may be thinking. but also i never really got involved with student orgs id thats what you are referring to as involved."
,,"we look like we are doing fine because we aren't testing enough students/frequently enough. plus typically the students that returned to campus are generally ""healthy"" and not immunocompromised so they manage to have mild-to-no symptoms. so they might not even realize they're positive yet have had covid. dorms have pretty strict rules in place. most classes are online. clusters come from west campus / greek life / parties"
,,"Public health. All medicine takes place in the context of people's lives. In my experience, that gets left out. Read Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies and Heat Wave for really good descriptions of why this context matters so much."
,,"So, I didnt really answer your question (just needed to rant about this shitty stream) but stay away from Quantum Computing. Nothing good will come out of it, its just pain. Good luck tho! FRI is a great experience for almost everyone else"
,,"One of the things I have always heard when comparing Castillian and Jester is that with Jester, you have a university meal plan which let's you eat at any location (e.g., Kins not just J2) but with Castillian you only get to eat there. Now of course things are different now with Covid with university dining and you won't necessarily need the ability to eat at multiple locations. Also, people have said that food quality has gone down when they went to a new meal plan method last year."
,,I liked it! The materials are kinda expensive so I had to shop around (~130-170) but overall there wasn't too much instruction from the professor I took and it truly was a time I could silently (or with music) enjoy myself. There are also critiques but even if you're just a beginner the professor was very helpful and as long as you try and get better over time you will get a good grade.
,,im guessing none of them survived to tell the tale lol
,,Just voted at Greg instead of FAC. Lines here were 10mins vs an hour (as of 2:15)
,,The biggest issue with Covid is in West Campus but that is entirely out of UT's control.

We're currently working on our ContribUTe campaign to benefit the UT Outpost Food Pantry, Student Emergency Services, and the Counseling and Mental Health Center!"
,,"Depends on your learning style. I have Davis this semester and she only does pdf lectures, not live ones, but its easier for me because I can go at my own pace (apparently she goes quite fast in live lectures). The only grades in her class are one question quizzes every 2 weeks, but theyve been really easy so far because they look almost identical to the practice questions that she releases."
,,"Do not stay at Casty. Its an overpriced POS filled with mid frat and sorority kids, with crap food."
,,i got a bunch from studio art classes
,,"You dont do any experiments, they expect you to know coding and then assign tough coding assignments without teaching you any coding AT ALL, and theres very little structure to the whole system. I feel like its the only FRI stream that had a midterm and a final! Everyone else was doing cool experiments and giving presentations on their research and my stream was just an unlucky bunch of dopes taking tests! I also disliked the professors teaching it. They were harsh graders and unforgiving asshats. Out of the 20 students who took the stream, I think less than half continued on with it."
,,"So i am a freshman thinking of taking a lab class and was wondering should I take bio206l which would be online or ch204 which would be hybrid and basically require me to be on campus(i live hours from austin) I was really planning on going back next fall bc i dont want to go back for one class. but which course do yall recommend i take first, bc if i don't take one of them next semester when what would be the best time to take it? I already plan on taking ch302 and bio311D, also should I take psy301 first or soc302? thank you in advance."
,,"I need an upper div writing flag, so I might as well knock it out with a CS UDE. I'd like to hear from people who took this class: what was the experience like? How difficult was it?"
,,"Im deciding whether to live on campus at Jester (idk whether to go with East or West) or live off campus at the Castilian next spring semester. I like how new, nicer, and cheaper the Castilian is but Ive heard it has a lot more greek life saturated there so its harder to make friends. Tbh Im a friendly and outgoing guy but Im a CNS major so realistically I wouldnt be partying every/all weekend long even if I did get invited to parties. So Im just curious on yalls opinion (and lmk which jester is better too pls)"

,,"Thats so nice, thank you!!"
,,"I know nothing of ECE and physics at IT, but in the aerospace department, students who take physics 1 and 2 off campus are know to not do as well in courses later onphysics is the basis for a lot of what we do, and courses off campus tend to not be as rigorous. So our advisors have always pushed students to take physics on campus. I think they even made physics 1 on campus a requirement (if you dont already have credit from AP or something, that is), so you may want to check in with your advisors on that."
,,"There's nothing stopping you from doing the integrated program, and taking Physics 2 over the summer or in the fall alongside 411."
,,the class is extremely easy :)
,,Im looking for places I can keep my car in for the whole weekend ://
,,"And honestly, asking your advisors these questions (especially about that integrated course youre looking at) would be a great idea. They will know more technical info than Reddit does."
,,"What this really means is you can sleep right up until 2 minutes before class if you need to. Truly, one of the few silver linings in this pandemic."
,,"In order to become a member of Sigma Pi Sigma, you must be classified as a junior or above in their physics or astronomy degree (60 total credit hours completed), 15 physics credit hours minimum completed, and a minimum 3.0 physics-only GPA."
,,"Took Physics 1 at a different school so cant comment on that but 303L was really not bad for me. I think I got lucky with my professor but 302 and 306 definitely felt harder to me. Especially for 303L, a big portion of the class is circuits which are super easy if youve done 302 already."
,,"With a 2.4 GPA, youre gonna have to have some incredible ECs to even have a shot. Admissions into UT w/o auto is comparable to ivys."
,,"Personally, I left bio lab with ochem and genetics and it worked out pretty well because there is very little work within bio lab to turn in (you only have a few reports and they are usually just a page long). I took chem lab (204) with gen chem 2 and I think it was helpful just to have them at the same time since the classes overlap in concepts"

,,"Take the integrated program; do physics at WTC. I recommend over the summer because the course, while not hard, is a pain in the ass."
,,I have HIS 345L lectures in there this semester.  New lecture halls are very nice
,,I feel like physics 2 was like 40% review of stuff Id already learned in other EE classes. Way easier than the first.
,,"So essentially the difference between ""Hybrid or Blended"" and ""Internet"" is that with the former you have the option to go in person if you wanted to but with Internet you do not?  And you can decide whether you want to skip in-person dynamically?"
,,"Your catalog might have a slightly different degree plan than mine, but I didn't have to take bio lab. Personally I like to take the labs and lectures concurrently (chem lab while in gen chem and ochem lab while in ochem) because the professor usually tries to sync up lecture material so that you learn about what you'll be doing in lab right before or during the week that you have that lab. To me it just makes it a lot easier to understand and write a decent lab report if the material is fresh in my head from lecture"
,,Yesss I wish I could have him again for an EE class
,,"Yes, I have heard it was pretty bad. I took it at Western Texas College online just in case. Most ECEs take it there online and they did online even before COVID. 312/319H with WTC would be easier than in person. You can also work on it over the summer."
,,okay that was really helpful thank you so much and when you say you can use bevo bucks at non ut places do you mean like off campus does that include jos coffe because I can not afford how many Laura palmers I want to drink every week
,,I've seen classes that have both options offered and the Internet days/times are the exact same as the Hybrid. So is that the professor giving a live lecture that is being streamed/zoomed to all the people not physically there?
,,"Depending on your school, there are departmental honors opportunities to pursue if you dont get accepted. I believe some honors programs even have transfer opportunities too once youre  a student."

,,I highly recommend Dr Markert!
,,priority deadline is november 1st so you're fine
,,"As a BME from my experience people vastly overhyped physics at UT as being very bad. I took both physics classes for engineers at UT and found them 100% fine. I think a lot of people who say that physics at UT is bad are just repeating what they hear from other people, even though none/very few of them have actually taken physics in residence"
,,Thank you! Ill let you know if i have any questions lmao
,,"One final note: taking physics at UT over the summer would probably Suck with a capital s. The course load is is no joke, and condensing it to a month or even 9 weeks just doesnt sound too fun at all. I almost took it over the summer, and Im glad I didnt. Also, lots of people are mentioning WTC for physics 2 over the summer and whatnot, and I havent heard great things about it. As an ECE student, you will want to take electricity and magnetism seriously."

,,It's like the speedway renovations for the year or two before us.
,,Okay! Thank you! My advisor was like people usually take it sophomore or junior year so that just made me unsure

,,"Yea people usually do take it their sophmore year , not quite sure why but its an easy class !"
,,Calc 2 winter mini at Hill College is not bad at all.
,,"hi !! im in the bdp program, but not social inequality, health & policy, so the information might differ a bit. in my experience, admissions were not very competitive (if at all). it might vary between concentrations but tbh i haven't heard of anyone being rejected. when you apply, the advisor will give you advice for how to strengthen your app before you send in the final copy . as long as you listen to their feedback and attend all the info sessions, you should be good to go"
,,"They combine your grades from community college and high school dual credit with your main university. For context, I had a 3.93 gpa from Texas A&M and I made a B in dual credit US History my sophomore year of high school. UT combined by A&M gpa and my high school dual credit for a total combined Gpa of 3.88"
,,"i was able to claim credit for the classes i've already submitted, as well ! i don't think that will be a problem for you"
,,"Physics at UT is tough, Id recommend taking Physics 1 & 2 at a community college, either in Spring & Summer or Summer and Fall, whichever semester you think is easier to add on to. For 312/319H, its more work than just doing 312, especially since you wont be in 411, but I didnt find it to be absurdly difficult. If you have some programming knowledge beyond the content of 306, youll be okay. 319 honestly felt the same as the regular section, and 312 was exciting to learn programming beyond assembly. Still tough, but really rewarding overall."
,,This is awesome. Is there anyway as a freshman to get involved with Sigma Pi Sigma?
,,Street parking around campus should be free in most places on Saturday after 6pm to Monday 8am. So basically you could come after 6pm or just pay for street parking until 6pm possibly
,,Im curious as to how many people are going to dorms vs apartments. I want to keep my single room in the dorms!
,,Im taking one now. Basically its a class where you can do everything online with the added bonus that lectures occur in person. This means that you can decide if you want to physically go to class (where we are socially distanced obviously) or just watch it online/Zoom.
,,"Go to the College Confidential boards to get the best admissions advice on UT. I will tell you that UT is one of the most competitive entry state schools in the U.S., and harder if youre an out-of-state student."
,,completion date is 3054
,,Markert is GOAT
,,I applied and my gpa is what it is and I let the admissions office know that my sat is next month and they are on the list to receive my scores
,,"Second, I live in San Jacinto and have a roommate so if you have any questions about the dorm DM me. The shower is pretty quiet if you want to shower at ungodly hours __. But the toilet is obnoxiously loud. Also I know someone on my floor has a support dog with them too, so it's not super unusual."
,,Thank you so much
,,"I took it over the summer at Hill College, it was all self-paced and very easy. Definitely recommend."
,,"Ch 204 is relatively manageable. Apart from the class time, if you set aside about 4 hours you should be good for the lab writeups"
,,You can stop going to class now. You will be dropped from the class
,,"So UT will combine your A, A- from UH with your As etc from community college. UT wont know whether you got a 90 or a 100 in your community college class. It just shows up as an A. UT will take into account the +- scale from UH"
,,"Might not be what youre looking for (nor helpful), but you could possibly look into some cryotherapy places. Ive heard theyre expensive though."
,,Thanks for the info. Did you do it online? And was it over a shorter term like winter or summer?
,,"204 was the most useless lab. Easy, though, and worth 2 credit hours. Id advise just taking it to get it out of the way, unless youre really overwhelmed."
,,"303K and 303L were tough, not impossibly hard, but kind of excessive in my opinion. I both made As in them so it is without a doubt doable. 103M and 103N are ridiculous online, they take up a lot of time, its probably the class(es) I worked the most in. If you want an easy route, take it at a community college."
,,"there's a specific prereq so just as long as you have that prereq, you can def take it in freshman year! highly recommend blondeau/ragsdale/woodward - taking blondeau rn, pm if you have more questions"
,,"Yes, SMART housing prices dont drop. For my apartment building there were only 2 spots available since everyone else was renewing and they were gone within the same day (my friend got one) so I would advise you to start asking around!"
,,But any UT student can join our discord for all the benefits mentioned in the post!
,,I'm a graduating senior and I don't think Welch lecture halls have ever had classes while I'm on campus.
,,I believe it is typically optional online or in person.

,,"Hi everyone,"
,,"My degree plan for a BS in Biochem suggests to take CH204 next semester with chem 2, but it seems like the only option is hybrid and I was planning on staying home and taking online bio lab instead. So, I'm thinking to push it back to next fall but was wondering if taking chem lab with the OChem and genetics (BIO325) on my degree plan would be a tough workload. Would I be better off taking bio lab or chem lab with my ochem and genetics?"
,,"Hey everyone,"
,,I'm thinking of taking biostat this spring semester (I'm a freshman) and I just wanted to know if it's too soon or if the class is so difficult that I should wait until sophomore or junior year?
,,"Hi, Im coming onto campus this weekend and I was wondering if there was a cheap/free lot or garage that I can park in for only Saturday-Monday morning? Or if anyone had a parking spot available for this weekend, that would totally be helpful too."
,,"I was wondering how exactly hybrid courses are structured because one of my classes next semester is only available as hybrid. Are lectures held online? What is exactly held in person? If anyone taking one could explain, I'd appreciate it."
,,"Hey, yall! I have multiple questions on multiple subjects so if you think you can help at all just say what you know or think. So I live in Georgia and am graduating high school in December. I have applied to be a German major starting spring 2021 at UT, UNT, and UNG(North Georgia). There is absolutely nothing i want more than to be in Austin. The thing is I have a 2.5 gpa. I was very sick freshman-junior years and was in and out of the hospital all of fall junior year. I really think my grades dont reflect my brain. I really do think I could do well enough to get into the schools I want on an SAT. Thing is I was planning on taking an SAT around now but a few months ago they stopped because of corona and eventually scores were waived for the class of 2021. I then had not yet decided to graduate early. Basically I emailed I think the head of admissions at UT to explain this and to say that there is an SAT on November 7th I could take but that is obviously after the deadline and his assistant replied and said I had everything else that I needed and that my application was already under review and to let her know if I did register for that SAT which I later did. So I guess I am asking if anyone knows some one who or is someone who had a not great gpa but got in with a decent test score? I think my situation could apply to whatever they do for special circumstances (Ive heard that you can go to UT Dallas or UT San Antonio for a year and if you maintain a 3.0 start as a sophomore in Austin ) The other three things are about housing. It really scares me that Im not going to make the most educated decision on which dorm to be in as I dont know anyone to speak from experience and I am an out of state. Even if I do make the right decision I am scared that it will not be available as I am coming in the spring. So Im going to say what my research has lead me to believe I want and I ask yall to correct me on which is actually best or if one Hall that I list doesnt allow freshmen or something. I believe that I would want a shared w/private, shared w/connecting, single w/private, or single/with connecting in the Duren Hall. For Kinsolving, a shared w/connecting and for San Jacinto, a shared w/private. This kind of leads to my next subject. I like people and would not mind a roommate at all but there are two things. 1. My three in the morning showers. 2. My emotional support animal. With my needs for a dorm probably already having very slim options, I just do not know about finding someone okay with this. I know that the ADA protects us and she will be allowed in any housing, but I do want to be positive that if I have a roommate, she doesnt mind at all that I have my baby and I would prefer that she is somewhat excited and I just really dont want to be setting off someones allergies. Also room because its literally a dog but Im not too worried because she is a 17 pound maltipoo. If you have a SD or ESA in the dorms or know someone who does please reply or message me to get in contact. Lastly, okay I guess this isnt so much about housing but more the dining halls. I am vegan do any vegans recommend the dining halls. would it be best to not do dining halls at all, get a small package and take care of the rest, or a full meal plan? Okay one more question sorry! What are bevo bucks? Thank you so much and hopefully I will be seeing yall soon! hook em horns! ____"
